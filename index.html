		My Life Ambition
	</h3>
	<p>
		A student, my life ambition might be to acquire knowledge and skills that empower me to contribute positively to society. I could aim to excel academically, pursue my passions, and work towards a career that aligns with my interests, all while fostering meaningful relationships and personal growth. Ultimately, my ambition would be to make a difference in the world, whether it's through innovation, creativity, or helping others.And also i want to create an institute where the poor childrens can have education with the funding. The childrens who are used or force to beg on the roads , i want to provide them a sound shleter where they can have education and gain skills. Might be possible one of them should be presenting our country in future.
